## Freebie
The Cybersecurity industry relies too much
on FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt).
FUD short-circuits rational thought and directly
triggers emotional reactions.
That is why vendors like it - but
quantitative risk analysis
involves
making informed-risk decisions based on economics,
which makes for better business decisions.
