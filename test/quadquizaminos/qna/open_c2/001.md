## OpenC2 Q1
Automating the defense is a key to cybersecurity.
Open Command & Control (OpenC2) is a standardized language
for the command and control of technologies
that provide or support cyber defenses.
By providing a common language for machine-to-machine communication,
OpenC2 is vendor and application agnostic, enabling interoperability
across a range of cyber security tools and applications.
The use of
standardized interfaces and protocols enables interoperability of
different tools, regardless of the vendor that developed them, the
language they are written in or the function they are designed to
fulfill.

OpenC2 is a specification by the OASIS OpenC2 Technical Committee.
