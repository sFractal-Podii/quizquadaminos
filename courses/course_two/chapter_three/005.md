## Comply to Connect
The focus of the October-2020
Cybersecurity Automation Workshop (CAW)
was the "comply to connect" use case:

When a new device attempts access to a network,
"comply2connect" determines whether to allow access
or to do any number of mitigating actions.
Supply chain plays a role in this decision.
A CACAO "playbook" may be used to instantiate the decision making process.
OpenC2 commands may be used to obtain the SBOM, and to
command/control the mitigating security controls (eg sandbox the device).

# Question:
Based on supply chain risk, what are possible actions?

## Answers
- patch the device
- connect the device
- quarantine the device
- deny access
- allow access but increase monitoring of the device
- initiate an investigation
* any of the above depending on the policy, and on the data received
