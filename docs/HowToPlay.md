# Quadblockquiz - Supply Chain Edition
Quadblockquiz is a tetrominoes-like game
that is part tetrominoes and part trivia quiz.
Being honest, the trivia is to educate on
supply chain. 

## 1. Getting started
It will hopefully be setup so you can play
anonomously.
But signing in allows you to win prizes in the contexts.
You can authenticate with an existing GitHub account,
or establish a handle using your email.

**replace this with some current example**

## 2. Playing

QuadBlocks or Tetrominoes
are shapes made from 4 squares.
In this game there are
![5 QuadBlock shapes](./quadblocks.png).

QuadBlocks fall from top of screen

Their fall is influenced by:
- Clicking the left-arrow key moves the quadblock one block to the left
- Clicking the right-arrow key moves the quadblock one block to the right
- Clicking the up-arrow key rotates the block one quarter turn

## 3. Objective
To score the most points
- Points accumulate with each tick of the clock
- Completed rows are removed and add points (in addition to letting you play longer)
- Answering questions add points as well as giving you powerups
- Game ends when:
   + you "lose" because the quadblocks pile up and reach the top of the playing area. Note this can occur via cyberattack or licensing lawsuit, not just by you letting the block accumulate
   + you quit gracefully (ie by hitting space bar and then clicking on quit button)
   + game times out after 10 min

## 4. Pausing / Questions
Typing the space bar pauses the game.
Note "pauses" is a misnomer as it only pauses the falling of the blocks.
The game timer continues, and lawsuits and cyberattacks can still occur.

When the space bar is hit, a topic screen is displayed,
allowing the player to either:
- continue back to the falling blocks part of the game, 
- quit the game,
- answer questions for points and powerups,
- invoke powerups (see [Power Ups](./powerups.md))

**replace this with current example**

See [Topics](./topics.md) for more on the various categories of topics
in the question and answer part of the game.

See [Power Ups](./powerups.md) for more on what powerups are 
and how they help defend against cyberattacks and lawsuits, 
and help you get more points.

See [Strategy](./strategy.md) for game strategy. 
TL;DR - alternating between falling blocks and Question/Answer
is the best strategy.

See [Intro Video](./needtoadd) for a video with some examples.
