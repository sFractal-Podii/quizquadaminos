# Categories/Topics in Quadblockquiz - Supply Chain Edition
Quadblockquiz is a tetrominoes-like game
that is part tetrominoes and part question/answer quiz.
Being honest, the question/answer is to educate on
supply chain cybersecurity. 

## 1. Getting started
The purpose of the game is to learn more about 
supply chain cybersecurity in a fun way.
See [How to Play](./HowToPlay.md) to get started.

## 2. Question/answer
The best strategy is to switch back and forth between
the falling blocks part of the game and the question/answer
part of the game. 
You switch from falling-blocks to question/answer by 
hitting the space bar.
You switch back by hitting the 'continue' button.
Note "pauses" is a misnomer as it only pauses the falling of the blocks.
The game timer continues, and lawsuits and cyberattacks can still occur.
Staying too long in either section will almost certainly 
result in unforseen bad things happening.

This page is about the question/answer part of the game.

## 3. What are Topics/Categories
The questions are usually multiple choice, 
and are designed test your knowledge of a particular topic,
or to teach you about that topic if you don't already know.

Each question has several parts:
- background
- question 
- possible answers
- skip the question
- points

Since this is a game with a finite time limit, you don't want to spend time
reading the background if you already know the answer.
However, even if you know nothing about the subject,
you should be able to answer the question with the information provided
in the background section.

For example, the answer to the question "What does C2 stand for in OpenC2?"
can be found in the background sentence "Open Command & Control (OpenC2) is a standardized language for the command and control ...".

Also included on each question is the points for correctly answering,
and the powerup you will gain. 
See [Power Ups](./powerups.md) for more on what powerups are 
and how they help defend against cyberattacks and lawsuits, 
and help you get more points.

Check if above still true????

The questions are divided into categories 
and tend to go up in value the deeper into the category you go.
The different topics will each be described in the following sections.

## 4. Topics or Categories of Questions

When the space bar is hit, a topic screen is displayed,
allowing the player to either continue back to the game, quit the game,
or answer questions for points and powerups

## 5. Topics / Power-ups

### 5.1 0Start
- Start here. Besides teaching you how to play the game, it contains some powerful powersups.

### 5.2 Sponsors
- this game, would not be possible without sponsors. Please read about them and answer easy questions to gain points and really good powerups/

### 5.3 Village
blah blah

### 5.4 Automation
blah blah

### 5.5 CACAO
blah blah

### 5.6 CSAF
blah blah

### 5.7 IoB
blah blah

### 5.8 Kestrel
blah blah

### 5.9 OCA
blah blah

### 5.10 OpenC2
- Automating the defense is a key to cybersecurity. Open Command & Control (OpenC2) is a standardized language for the command and control of technologies that provide or support cyber defenses. By providing a common language for machine-to-machine communication, OpenC2 is vendor and application agnostic, enabling interoperability across a range of cyber security tools and applications. The use of standardized interfaces and protocols enables interoperability of different tools, regardless of the vendor that developed them, the language they are written in or the function they are designed to fulfill.

- Answering incorrectly loses points and you remain paused until you answer correctly.
- Answering correctly gets you points and a ‘C2’ powerup which allows you to ‘command & control’ one block (and if you answer enough OpenC2 questions, an entire quadblock) to put where you want

### 5.11 Phoenix
- Phoenix is a web development framework written in Elixir which implements the server-side Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. Phoenix provides the best of both worlds - high developer productivity and high application performance. It also has some interesting new twists like channels for implementing realtime features and pre-compiled templates for blazing speed. The 'let it fail' philosophy of the underlying OTP ecosystem makes it easier to design in both reliability and security.

- Answering incorrectly loses points and you remain paused until you answer correctly
-  Answering correctly gets you points may get a ‘Rebirth’ powerup removing all blocks but keeps your score (and crediting points for the blocks removed), or may get you a ‘reliability’ powerup which "corrects" the vulnerable ‘black block’ into normal removable blocks.

### 5.12 Risk
blah blah

### 5.13 SBOM
- Software Bill of Materials is a critical element in supply chain risk management for both licenses and for vulnerabilities. It is also useful for software architecture (who needs 10 different modules with 27 different versions – all to perform the same function).
- More information at https://www.ntia.gov/sbom
- Answering incorrectly loses points and you remain paused until you answer correctly.
- Answering correctly gets you points and a ‘bomb’ powerup which allows you to ‘blow up’ one block (and if you answer enough SBOM questions, blow up an entire row)

### 5.14 STIX
blah blah

### 5.15 Supply Chain
- This is the supply chain sandbox so obviously everything is about supply chain.
- Questions in this section are historical and misc.
- Answering incorrectly loses points and you remain paused until you answer correctly
- Answering correctly gets you points.
