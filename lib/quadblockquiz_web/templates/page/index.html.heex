        <p class="font-light text-lg">
          You don't need to be a supply chain expert - this game assumes you are a novice
          and it teaches you what you need to know. You gain points by clearing rows as in a typical tetrominoes game.
          Here's the twist - you can answer quiz questions about supply chain both to gain points and to gain powerups.
        </p>
        <p class="font-light text-lg">
          Powerups help with classic tetrominoes strategy but also are needed to combat:
        </p>
        <ul class="font-light text-lg">
          <li>
            vulnerabilities (unfortunate gaps in an otherwise functioning security paradigm)
          </li>
          <li>licensing issues (extraneous blocks that gunk up the works)</li>
          <li>
            cyber attacks(rapid changes in operating conditions that take over entire sections of the gameboard and speed the game up uncontrollably)
          </li>
          <li>
            licensing lawsuits (tiresome procedures that gum up entire sections of the game board and slow the game to a snail's pace)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="font-light text-lg">
          Just like in real life, information powerups can prevent attacks and address emerging vulnerabilities as the operational environment speeds up and slows down around us.Play the game and find out!
