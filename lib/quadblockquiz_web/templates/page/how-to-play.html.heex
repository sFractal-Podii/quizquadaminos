  <p>Predictably patterned blocks will fall from the game's sky. It's your
    job to spin these blocks mid air to achieve a perfect fit on the game's ground level.</p>
  <ul class="pl-3.5 py-4">
    <li><span class="font-bold">LEFT ARROW</span> moves the block array leftwards</li>
    <li><span class="font-bold">RIGHT ARROW</span> moves the block array rightwards</li>
    <li><span class="font-bold">UP ARROW</span> pivots the block array 90 degrees</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once an entire row worth of empty spaces are filled with blocks, that row
    will disappear and your score will be suddenly flush with points. Conversely, if too
    many blocks accumulate vertically and extend past the skyline at the top of the game
    screen, it's lights out for you. Budget space and time wisely.</p>
  <p>Think of it this way: the game ends when you go out of business because your supply chain
    got too long and all the vulnerabilities you swept under the rug came back to haunt you.</p>

  <h2 class="heading-2 tracking-wider">3. CATASTROPHIC VULNERABILITIES</h2>
  <p>
    As much as we all wish this was the Atari in your parents' basement, this is the
    Cybersecurity Automation Village
    -- a venue to explore the vulnerabilities that haunt modern cyber security. Accordingly, we've built
    in a few little hiccups along the way to get you thinking about the supply chain of your block arrays.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the game, you may notice a few little hiccups that make it nigh on impossible to continue
    without earning a power up or two. Here are some of the fun little challenges life will throw your way:
  </p>
  <ol class="list-decimal py-4 pl-4">
    <li>Vulnerabilities (potential security holes in an otherwise functioning security paradigm)
      Any vulnerability in a row will prevent it being cleared.
      Vulnerabilities make it more likely that you'll be hit with a cyber attack (see below).
      A vulnerability's arrival is a function of game time and wrong answers to quiz questions.
      You will recognize a vulnerability on sight.
      Known vulnerabilities are yellow/gray blocks that appear either in dropping blocks
      or in uncleared blocks at the bottom.
      There are 4 in the gameover picture above.
      If you see one, you'd better get your power ups in order.</li>
    <li>
      licensing issues (extraneous blocks that gunk up the works)
      Licensing issues are brown/grey blocks that also prevent a row from being cleared.
      There is one in the gameover image above.
      The more license issues, the greater the likelihood of a lawsuit (see below).
      Like vulnerabilities, license issues are a function of game time and wrong answers to quiz questions.
    </li>
    <li>cyber attacks(rapid changes in operating conditions that take over entire sections
      of the gameboard and speed the game up uncontrollably).
      Ignore enough (5) vulnerabilities in your block supply chain and you'll be in
      for a nasty surprise.
      The game will accelerate to its fastest speed and an entire line of golden exploits
      will magically appear on your screen preventing operations.
      Hit the space bar!</li>
    <li>licensing lawsuits (tiresome procedures that gum up entire sections of the game board
      and slow the game to a snail's pace).
      Ignore enough (5) liscensing issues in your block supply chain and you'll be in
      for a nasty surprise.
      Not only will the game slow down to a snail's pace, but a fresh coat of pesky brown/grey injunctions
      will festoon your existing block arrays. Hit the space bar!</li>
  </ol>

<div class="p-6">
  <h2 class="heading-2 tracking-wider">4. SCORING</h2>
  <p></p>
  <p>Points are scored in several ways:</p>
  <bl>
    <li>Block drops. With every tic of the clock, the score increases
      (or decreases in the case of a cyberattack or lawsuit). The game as various speeds.
      A faster speed both increases how quickly the tics occur, but also increases
      the amount of points per tic.</li>
    <li>Rows cleared. The value of clearing a row
      raises exponentially with the number of rows cleared at once.
      Clearing one row might be worth 200 points
      and clearing 5 rows at once would be 3,200 points.</li>
    <li>
      Questions answered correctly. Each correct answer adds a number of
      points based on the number shown near the bottom of the question.
      Note incorrect answers subtract (usually fewer) points.
      Note different questions have different point scores - some quite large.
      It pays to play often and go thru all the questions so you know how to maximize your score.
    </li>
  </bl>
  <h3 class="heading-3 mt-6">_</h3>
  <img
    src={Routes.static_path(@conn, "/images/qbq.09.x.score.gif")}
    alt="exponential"
    class="max-h-64"
  />
  <h3 class="heading-3 mt-6">_</h3>
  <p>The amount of points scored is also influenced by game conditions.
    For instance, there is a mulitplier on the points for answering questions.
    A question worth 10 points is worth 20 points after just one block has dropped.
    That 10 point question is worth 30 points after 10 blocks,
    is worth 50 points after 20 blocks,
    is worth 70 points after 50 blocks,
    and is worth 110 points after 100 blocks.</p>
  <p>Besides the exponential nature of points for clearing rows,
    there is also a multipiler for questions answers correctly.
    Clearing 1 row is worth 200 points if no questions are answered correctly,
    is worth 400 points if one question was answered correctly,
    is worth 600 points if 10 questions answered correctly,
    is worth 1,000 points if 50 questions answered correctly,
    is worth 1,400 points if 100 questions answered correctly,
    and is worth 2,200 points if 30 questions answered correctly.
    Note the gif above showing the exponential nature of rows was from before this feature was implemented
    (ie assume is says 0 questions answered instead of 19).</p>

<div class="p-6">
  <h2 class="heading-2 tracking-wider">5. Quiz</h2>
  <p>Hitting the space bar pauses the falling blocks and
    pops up the quiz catetories.</p>
  <h3 class="heading-3 mt-6">_</h3>
  <img
    src={Routes.static_path(@conn, "/images/qbq-quiz.png")}
    alt="quiz categories"
    class="max-h-64"

  <h3 class="heading-3 mt-6">_</h3>
  <p>Hitting "Continue" brings you back to falling blocks.</p>
  <p>Hitting "End Game" cleanly ends the game.</p>
  <p>DO NOT CLICK on the "X" to close the quiz.
    This is clicking on a phishing email and bricking your game.
    There is no way out of this other than starting a new game.</p>
  <p>Clicking on a category brings up the next question in the quiz.</p>
  <h3 class="heading-3 mt-6">_</h3>
  <img
    src={Routes.static_path(@conn, "/images/qbq-question.png")}
    alt="quiz question"
    class="max-h-64"

  <p></p>
  <p>
    Each quiz question contains explanatory material that includes the answer to the question.
  </p>
  <p>
    Answer the question to receive points (see scoring).
    Click on your choice of answer and then click "Continue".
    Wrong answers subtract points. Wrong answers may also add vulnerabilities and/or licensing issues.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can click "skip question" to skip the question. This is useful on the last question in each category.
  </p>
  <p>Note that although the blocks are no longer falling, the clock is still running,
    and you can still be attacked while in quiz mode -particularly if you stay there too long.</p>

<div class="p-6">
  <h2 class="heading-2 tracking-wider">6. PRO TIPS</h2>
  <p>Just a little wisdom for thought for those with the ears to hear it.</p>
  <h3 class="heading-3 mt-6">Dropping Blocks vs Answering Questions</h3>
  <p>just like in real life, it is sometimes expedient
    to defer patches due to more imediate revenue needs,
    sometimes leaving vulnerability or license issues in place lets you build rows
    that can be cleared at once (since fix/add/delete/move/...
    are done while game is paused)
    - but be careful, since it also increases your likelihood
    of a cyberattack or lawsuit.</p>
  <p>It's not an easy tradeoff.</p>
  <p>The game is not tilted towards fixing - you will get a lower
    score if you spend all your time fixing.
    Conversely you will likely go out of business due to
    a cyberattack or lawsuit if ignore them entirely.
    The best strategy is trading off between the two,
    and investing in areas that reduce the likelihood
    (e.g. SBOM, Automation, ...) of them occuring in the first place.</p>
  <h3 class="heading-3 mt-6">End of Game</h3>
  <p>The cleanest way for the game to end
    (ie the highest liklihood your points will get recorded in the contest)
    is if you click the "end game" button after hitting the space bar.
    This should display a summary of how you did.
    If it's a high score, and you are in a contest, you might want to snap a pic.
    "just in case".</p>
  <p>The most likely way a game will end will be supply chain problems and the blockyard fills.
    This should also result in a summary of how you did.</p>
  <p>There is a 15 minute elasped time limit and the game will quit 15 minutes after you started.
    This "should' result in the game ending correctly with a summary displayed. But it would be safer
    to end cleaning by hitting the end button</p>
  <p>It is also possible there are bugs and the game will just reset. Sorry.
    The developers could claim this is a 'feature' representing a reallife ransomware 'bricking' your company,
    but we'd be lying. The reset is most likely to happen if you have a network interruption
    (there is a live steam to server doing the updates) or if you leave and don't enter anything for awhile
    (there is some timeout somewhere we haven't found yet which tears the connection down).</p>
  <h3 class="heading-3 mt-6">Getting Started</h3>
  <p>Easiet way to learn is to play.
    It is recommended to start with "0Start" category of questions as they should guide you through many aspects.
    Eventaully go thru all the questions in all the categories. Besides learning about automation projects you may not know,
    you'll learn where the high-point-value questions are so you can optimize in later games.
    Play many times. If the contests are active and you are elibible (ie registered for Village), enter a contest.
    Your chances of winning are much better than you think.</p>
