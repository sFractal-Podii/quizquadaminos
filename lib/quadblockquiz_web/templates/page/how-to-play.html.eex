<div class="p-6">
  <h2 class="heading-2 tracking-wider">1. THE BASICS </h2>
  <p>Predictably patterned blocks will fall from the game's sky. It's your
    job to spin these blocks mid air to achieve a perfect fit on the game's ground level.</p>
  <ul class="pl-3.5 py-4">
    <li><span class="font-bold">LEFT ARROW</span> moves the block array leftwards</li>
    <li><span class="font-bold">RIGHT ARROW</span> moves the block array rightwards</li>
    <li><span class="font-bold">UP ARROW</span> pivots the block array 90 degrees</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once an entire row worth of empty spaces are filled with blocks, that row
    will disappear and your score will be suddenly flush with points. Conversely, if too
    many blocks accumulate vertically and extend past the skyline at the top of the game
    screen, it's lights out for you. Budget space and time wisely.</p>
  <p>Think of it this way: the game ends when you go out of business because your supply chain
    got too long and all the vulnerabilities you swept under the rug came back to haunt you.</p>

  <h2 class="heading-2 tracking-wider">2. POWER UPS </h2>
  <p>In their infinite wisdom, the game developers have seen fit to bestow you with
    super human power ups. Simply press SPACE and correctly answer some real world trivia
    questions to access one of the following wildly effective tools:</p>
  <ul class="py-4 pl-4 leading-8">
    <li><i class="fas fa-plus-square"></i> add a block - useful to fill in holes</li>
    <li><i class="fas fa-square"></i> remove a block - useful to remove problem blocks</li>
    <li><i class="fas fa-arrows-alt"></i> move a block - helpful both to get a block 'out of the way' and to fill in hole</li>
    <li><i class="fas fa-eraser"></i> clear all blocks - use in attacked or sued, helpful if supply chain gets too long</li>
    <li><i class="fas fa-fast-forward"></i> speed up - needed if lawsuit is slowing your business</li>
    <li><i class="fas fa-fast-backward"></i> slow down - necesary if attacked, useful if game is going too fast</li>
    <li><i class="fas fa-wrench"></i> fix a vulnerability</li>
    <li><i class="fas fa-screwdriver"></i> fix a licensing issue</li>
    <li><i class="fas fa-hammer"></i> remove all vulnerabilities</li>
    <li><i class="fas fa-tape"></i> remove all licensing issues</li>
    <li><i class="fab fa-superpowers"></i> Superpower - exchange for any other powerup</li>
  </ul>
  <p>What? You don't need no stinkin' Power Ups? Guess again.</p>
</div>
<div class="p-6">
  <h2 class="heading-2 tracking-wider">3. CATASTROPHIC VULNERABILITIES</h2>
  <p>As much as we all wish this was the Atari in your parents' basement, this is the RSA Sandbox
    -- a venue to explore the vulnerabilities that haunt modern cyber security. Accordingly, we've built
    in a few little hiccups along the way to get you thinking about the supply chain of your block arrays.</p>
  <p>During the game, you may notice a few little hiccups that make it nigh on impossible to continue
    without earning a power up or two. Here are some of the fun little challenges life will throw your way:
  </p>
  <ol class="list-decimal py-4 pl-4">
    <li>vulnerabilities (potential security holes in an otherwise functioning security paradigm)</li>
    <ul class="py-4 pl-3.5 list-disc">
      <li>any vulnerability in a row will prevent it being cleared.</li>
      <li>vulnerabilities make it more likely that you'll be hit with a cyber attack (see below).</li>
      <li>a vulnerability's arrival is a function of game time and wrong answers to trivia questions.</li>
      <li>you will recognize a vulnerability on sight</li>
      <ul class="py-4 pl-3.5 list-square">
        <li>Known vulnerabilities are yellow/gray blocks that appear either in dropping blocks or in uncleared blocks at the bottom.</li>
        <li>Invisible vulnerabilities (zero days) are white-on-white blocks. If you see one, you'd better get your power ups in order.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>licensing issues (extraneous blocks that gunk up the works)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>licensing issues are brown/grey blocks that also prevent a row from being cleared.</li>
      <li>the more license issues, the greater the likelihood of a lawsuit (see below).</li>
      <li> like vulnerabilities, license issues are a function of game time and wrong answers
        to trivia questions</li>
    </ul>
    <li>cyber attacks(rapid changes in operating conditions that take over entire sections
      of the gameboard and speed the game up uncontrollably)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>ignore enough (5) vulnerabilities in your block supply chain and you'll be in
        for a nasty surprise</li>
      <li>the game will accelerate to its fastest speed and an entire line of exploits
        will magically appear on your screen preventing operations. Hit the space bar!</li>
    </ul>
    <li>licensing lawsuits (tiresome procedures that gum up entire sections of the game board
      and slow the game to a snail's pace)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>ignore enough (5) liscensing issues in your block supply chain and you'll be in
        for a nasty surprise</li>
      <li>not only will the game slow down to a snail's pace, but a fresh coat of pesky brown/grey injunctions
        will festoon your existing block arrays. Hit the space bar!</li>
    </ul>
    <li>answering questions alone won't save you -- vulnerabilities can appear with catastrophic 
      consequences at any juncture in the game!</li>
  </ol>
</div>
<div class="p-6">
  <h2 class="heading-2 tracking-wider">4. SCORING</h2>
  <p>Points are scored in several ways:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>chronological longevity / block drops</li>
    <li>rows cleared</li>
    <li>questions answered</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The amount of points scored is also influenced by game conditions.
    For instance, the value of clearing a row
    raises exponentially with the number of rows cleared at once.</p>
</div>
<div class="p-6">
  <h2 class="heading-2 tracking-wider">5. PRO TIPS</h2>
  <p>tetrominos vs quiz</p>
  <p>just like in real life, it is sometimes expedient
    to defer patches due to more imediate revenue needs,
    sometimes leaving vulnerability or license issues in place lets you build rows
    that can be cleared at once (since fix/add/delete/move/...
    are done while game is paused)
    - but be careful, since it also increases you likelihood
    of a cyberattack or lawsuit.</p>
  <p>It's not an easy tradeoff.</p>
  <p>The game is not tilted towards fixing - you will get a lower
    score if you spend all your time fixing.
    Conversely you will likely go out of business due to
    a cyberattack or lawsuit if ignore them entirely.
    The best strategy is trading off between the two,
    and investing in areas that reduce the likelihood
    (e.g. SBOM, Automation, OpenChain) of them occuring in the first place.</p>
  <p>Nothing lasts forever, even the QuadBlockQuiz. The game will have one of four conclusions:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>You reach the maximum time limit of 15 minutes. Note: This includes 
      time spent in the menu or time spent answering questions, not just gameplay.</li>
    <li>The vulnerabilities and game play overwhelm you and overflow the top of the game area.</li>
    <li>You fall victim to vulnerabilities that manifest while you are answering questions and return to discover defeat.</li>
    <li>You EXIT the game.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Perceptive competitors will notice silent multipliers in play. Questions are worth far more points and row clearing is far more 
    profitable when there are more blocks on the screen. The game, like real life, rewards performance in high pressure situations.</p>
  <p>Just a little wisdom for those with the ears to hear it.</p>
