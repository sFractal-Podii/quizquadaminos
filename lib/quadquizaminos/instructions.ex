    <h2>Explore Cyber Security's Most Important Emerging Strategic Focus with the Digital Era's Most Beloved Game</h2>
    <p>We proudly present the SupplyChainSandbox edition of QuadBlocksQuiz -
       a reimagined take on Tetris where playful spatial negotiations are infused with
       real-life Trivia challenges from the world of supply chain security.</p>
    <h2>Why Play?</h2>
    <p>Whether you're attending RSAC because you "sell security" or "buy security," you can't afford
  to pass on this love child of Tetris and Trivia. More than abstract configurations of digital blocks,
  our Tetris spin-off envisions the classic arcade game as a potent metaphor for supply chain cyber security.
  You can choose to let the blocks fall as they may and scramble to cope with the accumulated consequences at
  a later point in time, or you can utilize savvy forecasting and informational superiority to address each
  element as it appears on the horizon.</p>
 <p>As recent events have shown, you are only as protected as the weakest link in your supply chain.
  Guarding your organization’s information in a digitally-connected world
  means understanding not only your organization’s immediate supply chain,
  but also the security of the extended ecosystem and all entities involved.
  Besides the obvious enterprise advantage of robust supply chain security knowledge,
  the tidbits offered up here will reappear as in-game trivia challenges. </p>
<h2>Power Up!</h2>
  <p>You don't need to be a supply chain expert - this game assumes you are a novice
  and it teaches you what you need to know. You gain points by clearing rows as in a typical Tetris game.
  Here's the twist - you can answer quiz questions about supply chain both to gain points and to gain powerups.</p>
  <p>Powerups help with classic Tetris strategy but also are needed
  to combat:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>vulnerabilities (unfortunate gaps in an otherwise functioning security paradigm)</li>
   <li>licensing issues (extraneous blocks that gunk up the works)</li>
   <li>cyber attacks(rapid changes in operating conditions that take over entire sections
       of the gameboard and speed the game up uncontrollably)</li>
   <li>licensing lawsuits (tiresome procedures that gum up entire sections of the game board
       and slow the game to a snail's pace)</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Just like in real life, information powerups can prevent attacks
       and address emerging vulnerabilities as the operational environment speeds up and slows down around us.
       Play the game and find out!
   </p>
<h2>How to play</h2>
    <p>The game involves completing rows for points or answering questions for points.
    There are many different aspects covered in the following sections:
    <ol>
      <li>Objective</li>
      <li>Movement</li>
      <li>Speed</li>
      <li>Scoring</li>
      <li>Vulnerabilities, Licensing Issues, Cyberattacks, Lawsuits</li>
      <li>Quiz</li>
      <li>Sponsors</li>
      <li>Powerups</li>
      <li>Prizes / Contests</li>
      <li>Strategy, Tips & Tricks</li>
      <li>Developer Hacks</li>
    </ol></p>
    <p>
    Note that some of the features described here
    are still in development.
    If a feature has a "#", it indicates the feature is incomplete.
    A number after the hash tag means it it that issue/story on the project board.
    </p>
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>The objective of the game is to move and rotate falling geometric shapes
    (quadblocks)
    to form complete rows at the bottom of the game board,
    gaining points in process.
    Answering questions also adds points and sometimes gives the player
    "powerups" which help with playing the game.
    </p>
    <p>
    Of course, the real objective is teach you about supply chain security
    in a fun an entertaining manner.
    </p>
    <p>
    The game ends when you go out of business because
    "your supply chain gets too long"
    and something goes wrong in your supply chain
    i.e. the stack of blocks reaches the top of the game board.

    <h3>Movement</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Up arrow key rotates the blocks</li>
          <li>Left arrow key moves the blocks to the left</li>
          <li>Right arrow key moves the blocks to the right</li>
          <li>Down arrow key moves the blocks down</li>
          <li>space bar pauses game and brings up quiz</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Speed</h3>
    <p>Speed refers to how fast the quadblocks fall.
      There are 7 speeds to the game:
        <ul>
          <li>"full throttle" - ~20 rows per second</li>
          <li>"high speed" - ~10 rows per second</li>
          <li>"fast" - ~4 rows per second</li>
          <li>"moderate" - ~3 rows per second</li>
          <li>"leisurely" - ~2 rows per second</li>
          <li>"sedate" - ~1.5 rows per second</li>
          <li>"lethargic" - ~1 rows per second</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
      Speed affects scoring in several ways which will be described under scoring
      </p>
      <p>
      The game starts at a "fast" speed.
      The game speeds up gradually (ie one step in above list) over time (#?).
      </p>
      <p>If a "Cyberattack" (see section whatever) occurs,
      the game jumps to "full throttle" from whatever speed it was on (#?).
      </p>
      <p>If a "License Lawsuit" (see section whatever) occurs,
      the game jumps to "lethargic" from whatever speed it was on(#?).
      </p>
      <p>Powerups (see later section) can be used to:
        <ol>
          <li>speed up one notch (#?)</li>
          <li>slow down one notch (#?)</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Scoring</h3>
    <p>Points are scored in several ways:
        <ol>
          <li>clock ticks / block drops</li>
          <li>clearing rows</li>
          <li>answering questions</li>
        </ol>
    The amount of points scored is also influenced by multipliers.
    The multipliers may increase the score
    (e.g. operating at quicker speeds mulitplies the value of clearing a row)(#?)
    or may decrease the score (e.g. the more vulnerabilities on the board,
    the lower the value of clearing a row)(#?)
    </p>
    <p>
    For each clock tick, the block in play drops one row and the score changes.
    How much it increases/decreases depends on the speed.
    Obviously faster speeds make clock ticks more often.
    But in addition, each tick is worth more at faster speeds(#?):
      <ul>
        <li>"full throttle": 4 points per tick</li>
        <li>"high speed": 3 points per tick</li>
        <li>"fast": 2 points per tick</li>
        <li>"moderate": 1 point per tick</li>
        <li>"leisurely": 0 points per tick (ie score does not increase)</li>
        <li>"sedate": (-1) point per tick(ie score actually decreases)</li>
        <li>"lethargic": (-5) points per tick(ie score actually decreases)</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
    Clearing rows gains points as well as frees up space to play longer.
    The amount of points for clearing a row depends on
    (1) the number of rows cleared in that tick
    (2) the multipliers.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is possible to fill more than one row
    when a quadblock reaches the "bottom".
    The amount of points goes up exponentially
    with the number of rows filled.
    If no multipliers are in affect, then the points are
    100 times 2 to the power of the number of rows. eg:
      <ol>
        <li>1 row = 200 points</li>
        <li>2 row = 400 points</li>
        <li>3 row = 800 points</li>
        <li>4 row = 1,600 points</li>
        <li>etc</li>
      </ol>
    It might appear that the highest number of rows that could be cleared
    in one tick would be 4 - the length of the longest quadblock.
    Howevers there are some tips & tricks with powerups (see later section)
    that the clock is 'frozen' while you are doing add/delete/move/etc
    and more importantly that rows completed with add/move do not score
    until the falling brick touches joins the bottom blocks.
    </p>
    <p>
    put 5 row example gif here
    </p>
    <p>
    Which means you could, in theory at least,
    complete almost as many rows as there are on the board.
    10 rows would be 102,400 points.
    15 rows would be 3,276,800 points.
    And that is before multipliers.
    </p>
    <p>
    Multipliers increase the score.
    One multiplier is the speed at the tick that clears the row:
      <ul>
        <li>"full throttle": Multiplier = 4</li>
        <li>"high speed": Multiplier = 3</li>
        <li>"fast": Multiplier = 2</li>
        <li>"moderate": Multiplier = 1</li>
        <li>"leisurely": Multiplier = 1</li>
        <li>"sedate": Multiplier = 1</li>
        <li>"lethargic": Multiplier = 0.5 (ie less points)</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
    Other multipliers are TBD
    </p>
    <p>
    The third way to score points is by answering questions.
    Each question gives a certain amount of points for a correct answer.
    It also subtracts for incorrect answers,
    but the scoring is setup such that even if you don't get it correct
    until the last guess, you will still be ahead
    albeit not as far ahead as getting it correct on first try.
    </p>
    <p>
    Points per question increase as you get further into questions
    in a given category.
    </p>
    <p>
    Answering questions also adds powerups for some questions.
    See later section.
    </p>
    <h3>Vulnerabilities, Licensing Issues, Cyberattacks, Lawsuits</h3>
    <p>
    Normal blocks are squares of one color (two tones).
    But just like in real life, problems can crop up in your supply chain.
    There are two types of vulnerabilities.
    Known vulnerabilities are yellow/gray blocks
    that show up at random either in dropping blocks
    or in the blocks at the bottom that haven't been cleared yet.
    Invisible vulnerabilities (zero days) are white-on-white blocks
    that you only notice thru behavior (#?).
    </p>
    <p>
    Vulnerabilities have several impacts.
    The main impact is that any vulnerability in a row will prevent
    it being cleared (#104).
    There is also a subtle impact that the more vulnerabilities,
    the more likely you will be hit with a cyber attack(#?).
    The speed at which vulnerabilities arrive is a function of time(#?),
    a function of the number of wrong answers to questions(#?),
    and is slowed down by enabling certain powerups(#?).
    </p>
    <p>
    License errors are similar.
    They are brown/grey blocks (#?),
    and also prevent a row from being cleared.
    The more license errors,
    the higher the likelihood of a lawsuit(#?).
    The speed at which license errors arrive is a function of time (#?),
    a function of the number of wrong answers to questions(#?),
    and is slowed down by enabling certain powerups(#?).
    </p>
    <p>
    Cyberattacks occur from ignoring vulnerabilities
    in your supply chain(#?).
    Cyberattacks speed the game up to the highest speed(#?),
    and cause an entire blocking row of IOCs (grey/yellow)
    at row 10 (#?).
    Cyberattacks are cleared with powerups.
    </p>
    <p>
    Lawsuits occur from ignoring license errors
    in your supply chain(#?).
    Lawsuits slow the game down to the lowest speed(#?),
    and cause lawsuit blockers (grey/brown)
    in rows 5-15
    at column 5(#?).
    Lawsuits are cleared with powerups.
    </p>

      Some powerups only can be obtained from obtaining multiple other powerups.
    </p>
    <p>
      All combo superpowers require having the superpower powerup as well as the
      other necessary powerups.
      </p>
      <p>
      For example, the <i class="fas fa-ribbon"></i> ribbon/badge slows
      down the arrival rate of vulnerabilties.
      To obtain this ribbon/badge, you must have and click on the
      superpower badge after already having at least one SBOM powerup
      and one automation powerup in your stash.
      When you click on the superpower powerup, the ribbon/badge
      will appear as one of powers you can exchange for.
      Picking it removes one superpower, one SBOM, and one automation
      from your stash and adds one ribbon/badge to your stash.
      Note you still need to click on the ribbon/badge to activate it.
      </p>
      <p>
      Similarly, the <i class="fas fa-certificate"></i> certificate badge
      requires superpower, SBOM, OpenChain.
      </p>
      <p>
      <i class="fas fa-file-prescription"></i> fix a cyberattack
      requires superpower, SBOM, forensics, automation, legal, cyberinsurance
      </p>
      <p>
      <i class="fas fa-syringe"></i> fix a lawsuit
      requires superpower, SBOM, legal, openchain, cyberinsurance
      </p>

    <h3>Strategy, Tips & Tricks</h3>
    <p>tetris vs quiz</p>
    <p>
    timing funny wrt QnA/powerups - multi-row clearing trick
    </p>
    <p>
    just like in real life, it is sometimes expedient
    to defer patches due to more imediate revenue needs,
    sometimes leaving vuln or lic-issue in place lets you build rows
    that can be cleared in a larger block
    - but be careful since it also increases you likelihood
    of a cyberattack or lawsuit.
    It's not an easy tradeoff.
    The game is not tilted towards fixing - you will get a lower
    score if you spend all your time fixing.
    Conversely you will likely go out of business due to
    a cyberattack or lawsuit if ignore them entirely.
    The best strategy is trading off between the two,
    and investing in areas that reduce the likelihood
    (e.g. SBOM, Automation, OpenChain) of them occuring in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
    Note some of the powerups work best in tandem.
    For example having an SBOM by itself does not do anything.
    Neither does having automation.
    But having an SBOM in combination with automation
    drastrically reduces the vulnerability arrival rate
    as well as reducing the chance of cyberattack.
    Similarly with SBOM and OpenChain for licensing issues.
    </p>
    <p>
    Note slowing down vuln/lic means it can still happen,
    just less likely.
    </p>
    <p>
    The richer you are (ie the higher your score),
    the more  tempting target you are for cyberattack
    and lawsuits (#?) so the more you need your ducks in a row.
    </p>
    <h3>Developer Debug</h3>
    This section contains "cheats" used by developers
    while the game is still in development.
    Like any good hacker, you can watch this section
    and maybe find some backdoors if we forget to take them out.
    OR it's possible we will tie these keys to intrusion alarms
    and it will be game over if you use them.
    </p>
