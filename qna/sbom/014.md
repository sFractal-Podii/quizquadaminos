## This game SBOM
Before logging into this game,
the home page contained a link
that opens an SBOM in a new tab/window.
This SBOM is in CycloneDX JSON format
and is the SBOM for this game.

This SBOM was created as part of the
build process for this game.
The code is written in elixir and
was built using the Phoenix Framework.

The build process uses hex/sbom
during the build, creating the SBOM artifact, which was then included in the webserver.
