## This game SBOM
Before logging into this game,
the home page contained a link
that opens an SBOM in a new tab/window.
This SBOM is in CycloneDX JSON format
and is the SBOM for this game.

This SBOM was created as part of the
build process for this game.
The code is written in elixir and
was built using the Phoenix Framework.

Mix is the elixir build tool
and hex is the elixir package manager.
The sbom package in hex
(https://hexdocs.pm/sbom/readme.html)
can be used
by mix to create the SBOM as the
application is being built.
That is how the SBOM
for this game was created.
