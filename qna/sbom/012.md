## Can SBOMs be created?
The NTIA https://www.ntia.gov/sbom website
includes information on work being done
in the healthcare industry with SBOMs.
See https://www.ntia.gov/files/ntia/publications/ntia_sbom_healthcare_poc_report_2019_1001.pdf.
Participants included both
Medical Device Manufactuers (MDMs)
and
Healhcare Delivery Organizations (HDOs).
The conclusion states:
The Healthcare SBOM PoC demonstrated that
software bills of material
can be successfully produced
by medical device manufacturers,
as well as consumed by
healthcare delivery organizations.
The information contained in the SBOMs
produced for the PoC provided
software transparency that
previously was not available to the HDOs,
and improved their
overall risk management and operational
approaches.
