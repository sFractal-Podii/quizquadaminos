## Software Bill of Materials
A “Software Bill of Materials” (SBOM) is
effectively a nested inventory,
a list of ingredients that make up
software components.

The recent Executive Order on Supply Chain Cybersecurity
defined SBOM as a formal record containing the details and supply chain
relationships of various components used in building software.  
Software developers and vendors often create products by
assembling existing open source and commercial software components.  
The SBOM enumerates these components in a product.  
It is analogous to a list of ingredients on food packaging.  
An SBOM is useful to those who develop or manufacture software,
those who select or purchase software, and those who operate software.
