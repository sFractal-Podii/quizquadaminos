## Quantitative Risk
Loss exccedance curves are used
to quantitatively measure risk.
In this graph, the blue shows the probability
of financial loss due to cyber incidents
in the next year.
The red line shows how a new shiny widget
from the RSAC showroom floor costs $500K
(hence 100% chance of that cost) but
most likely saves $5M
(the loss reduction at 50% on the red line compared
to that point on the blue line).

However, the introduction of this new security technology
also introduces some supply chain risk as the widget has
a low probability (but high impact) as a threat vector
(as the customers of Solar Winds discovered).
