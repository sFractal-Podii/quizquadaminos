## CyberInsurance
The International Telecommunications Union (ITU)
is the UN agency for information and communication technologies (ICTs),
and sets standards in this area.
ITU Study Group 17 on cybersecurity is drafting guidelines
on cybersecurity insurance acquisition discusses the concept of
"silent cyber coverage"
which cyber refers to potential cyber-related losses
stemming from traditional property and
liability policies that were not specifically designed to cover cyber risk.
If a policy does not affirmatively grant or exclude cyber coverage,
there is no guarantee that it will actually cover a loss.

It recommends organizations should not be dependent on silent cyber coverage
and may need to consider affirmative coverage
or a standalone cyber insurance policy to cover such losses.
