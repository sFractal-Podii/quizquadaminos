## STIX
Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) is a language and serialization format 
used to exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI). 

With STIX, an OASIS Open Standard, sharing and ingesting cyber threat intelligence becomes a lot easier. 
With STIX, all aspects of suspicion, compromise and attribution can be represented clearly 
with objects and descriptive relationships. 
STIX information can be visually represented for an analyst or stored as JSON to be quickly machine readible. 
STIX's openness allows for integration into existing tools and products 
or utilized for your specific analyst or network needs.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) uses STIX in it's 
Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) for sharing
threat activity context such as tactics, techniques, and procedures, vulnerabilities, and courses of action.
STIX is used in AIS with many Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) including
Health ISAC, Multi-State ISAC, Water ISAC, Financial Services ISAC, Autommotive ISAC, and many more.
