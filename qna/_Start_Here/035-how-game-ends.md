## How Game Ends
The game ends when
- you quit (click on "End Game" button Quiz pop-up)
- you ran out of time (all games limited to 15 minutes)
- you go out of business because your supply chain got too long
   + because you weren't quick enough +/or didn't use your powerups
   + you couldn't weather a cyberattack caused by leaving too many vulnerabilities untended
   + you couldn't weather a licensing lawsuit caused by leaving too many licensing issues untended

Note the 15 minute game time is total elapsed time from start
and is independent of time spent in quiz, in quadblocks,
or on bio breaks.
A timer is provided in the scoreboard area so
you know how much time you have left.
Don't wait too long on that 5-row completion.

At the conclusion of each game, you will be shown your stats
and your final board configuration.
If your id is known (ie you weren't playing anonymously),
your score will be recorded on the leaderboard.
If you were part of a contest,
it will also show on the contest leaderboard.
