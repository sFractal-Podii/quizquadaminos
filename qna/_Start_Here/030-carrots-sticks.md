## QuadBlocks vs Quiz - Carrots and Sticks

Which will get more points - QuadBlocks or Quiz? Neither!

You will need to develop your own strategy
but there are carrots and sticks to encourage you to
switch back and forth between QuadBlocks and Quiz.

You score more points for complete rows
if you have more answered questions.

You score more points for correct answers if you have more blocks.

If all you do is play quadblocks,
then vulnerabilities and licensing
issues will block rows,
and eventually lead to a cyberattack or a lawsuit.

If all you do is answer questions,
vulnerabilities and licensing issues
will still creep in and eventually lead to a cyberattack
or lawsuit - and you won't even notice
since you aren't looking at QuadBlock board.

By the way, if you have gotten to this question,
then at least one vulnerability or licensing issue has
occurred because you aren't paying enough attention to
running your business (QuadBlocks). You might want to go check.
