The Open Cybersecurity Alliance (OCA) is
making standards-based, interoperable cybersecurity a reality.
OCA develops standardized data interfaces
to support an open ecosystem where cybersecurity tools 
interoperate without the need for custom integrations.

OCA is a nonprofit, global collaboration of software providers, end users, 
government agencies, research institutes 
and individuals committed to enabling the free exchange of 
information, insights, analytics, and response across cybersecurity tools. 

An open source project, OCA operates under the OASIS Open governance process, which ensures transparency, 
inclusiveness, and safety, with a path to standardization in international policy and procurement.
