Malicious actors,
believed to be acting on the behest of the Russian government,
infiltrated the software build process the company Solar Winds
used to create it's Orion network management software.
By inserting malware into the customers of Solar Winds,
the malicious actors were able, among other things,
to breach the emails
of the very government officials tasked with
identifying foreign threats to US national security.
Chad Wolf, appointed acting secretary of the US Department of
Homeland Security by President Donald Trump in December 2019,
was reportedly among the officials whose email accounts were hacked.
