## Language and Resources
In an enterprise environment dominated by the functionality of formal languages,
we often forget the importance of off-the-cuff natural language.

# Question:
Which of these is a less than suitable metaphor for the SBOM?

## Answers
- A health-conscious diet guru scrutinizing the labels of food stuffs at an organic grocery store before purchasing.
-	Kicking the tires and getting a good look at the engine (to say nothing of poring over a Carfax report) before buying a used car.
*	Walking blindfolded and hands out toward an operating wood chipper.
-	Cross referencing your prescription with a list of side-effects and negative interactions.
