## UKRAINE Impact On Global Supply Chains
The war in Ukraine has caused numerous impacts to supply chains:
cargo airlines to cancel or divert flights over the region,
Ukrainian factories to cease operations,
and energy prices to escalate in anticipation of supply shortages.
It puts at risk global supplies of essential components for
manufacturing including platinum, aluminum, and steel.
Impacts on global supply chains have been extraordinary
as the lack of these components has driven global shortages of
everything from vehicles and computer chips
to supplies of wheat and other basic agricultural products.

# Question
How does localized risk to supply chains, such as in Ukraine, manifest itself in the global market?

## Answers
- Supply chains can quickly be diverted to alternate sourcing to eliminate impacts and meet demand
- There is minimal impact given national economies can react internally.
- Most critical components can be replaced by substitution.
- Risks of single, offshore sourcing must be carefully anticipated in supply chain plans.
