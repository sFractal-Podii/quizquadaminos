## Container Fires
Shipping safety has improved dramatically
with a 70% decrease in ship total losses
over the last decade.
However, there has been a substantial increase
over the last decade in the number of fires in containers carried onboard.
There is a fire onboard a container ship every week,
with a major container fire occurring on average every 60 days.
