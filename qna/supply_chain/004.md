## Natural Disasters Impact Supply Chain
Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in September, 2017
which had a large impact on the island's
largest export - pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
Saline bags are a commonplace item yet they are crucial
to virtually every hospital patient.
The hurricane resulted in Lack of electricity and physical damage to a major supplier
of saline bags; which in turn resulted in a nationwide shortage
lasting more than a year.
