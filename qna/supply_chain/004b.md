## Supply chain lessons from Haiti earthquake - 2010
When disaster relief teams tried to reach Haiti after the earthquake,
all entry routes for people and goods were blocked,
communications were down, roads were blocked and storage facilities destroyed.
Both NGOs (non-governmental organizations) and military units had to rapidly
implement alternative access capability by sea and air and leverage them
respond in real time to major unexpected demand and supply situations.  
Establishing a presence on the ground with a
clear chain-of-command was critical.
Establishing alternate communication capability was fundamental.

# Question:

disaster relief operations?

## Answers
- Disaster response represents “business as usual” for supply chains.
