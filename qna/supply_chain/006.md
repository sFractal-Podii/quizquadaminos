## Explosions
A large supply chain disruption in 2015 resulted from
several large explosions in a Chinese port near Bejing.
173 people died - 104 of which were firefighters responding
to the initial explosion.
In total, 304 buildings, 12,428 cars, and 7,533 containers were damaged,
resulting in a $9B supply chain disruption.
Yet this was only the 3rd-most disruptive event of 2015,
being topped by Typhoons Dujuan ($10B) and Soudelor ($20B).
