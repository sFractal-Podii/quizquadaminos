## Supply chains in battle
During the Gulf War, planners for Operation Iraqi Freedom
recommended 60 days of supplies in theater before commencing the ground attack.
In actual execution, while massive amounts of supplies were obtained,
forces on the ground could not see the contents of the containers
once they were in transit or in theater.
As a result, fully half of the supplies sent to the region were never used.
Inventory visibility is critical.
Logisticians and operators must know what they have—the condition
and location of the items—and manage the flow of supplies
as conditions and customer demand evolves.
