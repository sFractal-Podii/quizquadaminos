## Apollo Disaster

Apollo 13 had an onboard explosion due to a a supply chain problem.
The onboard electrical systems were originally designed
to run off 28V.
A design change was made to run off 65V and
the supplier of one particular
thermostat was not notified of the design change.
The over-voltage welded the thermostat shut,
did not shut off the heater,
causing excess gas to be present,
and then sparked
which resulted in the overheating that led to the explosion.

# Question
What was the ROOT CAUSE of the Apollo 13 disaster?

## Answers
- an explosion (due to a spark igniting excess gas)
- a spark (due to voltage mismatch)
- excess gas (due to thermostat failure)
- failure to inform a supplier of a requirements change

## Score
