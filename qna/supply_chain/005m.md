## Apollo Disaster

Apollo 13 had an onboard explosion due to a a supply chain problem.
The onboard electrical systems were originally designed
to run off 28V.
A design change was made to run off 65V and
the supplier of one particular
thermostat was not notified of the design change.
The thermostat welded shut,
did not shut off the heater
causing excess gas to be present,
and then sparked
which resulted in the overheating that led to the explosion.
