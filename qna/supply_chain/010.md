## Reshoring to avoid supply chain risk
Supply chains have been impacted
by recent world events
such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine,
and closing of Baltimore Harbor due to the ship crashing into
the Francis Scott Key Bridge.
This creates massive volatility and unpredictability.
Those costs will be passed on to consumers in the form of
higher prices.
Entire supply chains will be rewritten, with new sources
and partners â€” all in the interest of
corporate and national security
