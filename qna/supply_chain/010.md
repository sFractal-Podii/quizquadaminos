## Reshoring to avoid supply chain risk
Given the impacts of recent world events
such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine,
sourcing and transportation of goods
across the Eurasian continent will become more complex, and possibly
contested.  
This will create massive volatility and unpredictability.
Those costs will be passed on to consumers in the form of
higher prices.
Entire supply chains will be rewritten, with new sources
and partners â€” all in the interest of
corporate and national security

Aside: the next question in this category
is worth the most of any question in the game.
So you might want to make sure you've played some
QuadBlocks to get your multiplier larger.
