Given the impacts of recent world events
such as the COVID-19 pandemic, souring and transportation of goods
across the Eurasian continent will become more complex, and possibly
contested.

Those costs will be passed on to consumers in the form of
higher prices.
Entire supply chains will be rewritten, with new sources
and partners â€” all in the interest of
corporate and national security
