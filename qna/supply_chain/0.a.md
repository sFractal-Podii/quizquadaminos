## Supply Chain

This category is
a potpourri of questions
on supply chain past and present.
Get points and get powerups
by answering the questions correctly.

Powerups for this category include:
- add block - useful for filling in holes that may result from falling blocks but may also result from other powerups like delete block, remove all vulnerabilities, and remove all licensing issue
- speed up - if the game isn't fast enough for you, this will make the blocks drop faster. It's essential if you are sued over licensing issues which slows your profits to a snails pace.
- slow down - if the game is moveing too fast, this will make the blocks drop more slowly. It's essential if you are attacked when things are moving too quickly and your profits are bleeding away.
- fix one vulnerabilities - a very useful powerup for preventing attacks
- fix one licensing issues  - a very useful powerup for preventing law suits

Note an attack occurs when there are 5 vulnerabilities in the blockyard
(the bottom collection of stopped blocks).
Similarly a lawsuit occurs when there are 5 licensing issues.

# Question:
In this game (admittedly an artificial construct),
how many licensing issues result in a lawsuit?
