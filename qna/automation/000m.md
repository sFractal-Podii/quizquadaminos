## Cybersecurity Automation Workshop
In his keynote at the October-2020
Cybersecurity Automation Workshop (CAW)
Neal Ziring,
Cyber Technical Director at the US National Security Agency,
emphasized the need for security automation.
He pointed to cyber attacker’s use of automation –
and that our defenses must also take advantage of automation for speed and scale.
Interoperable automation standards are essential, he asserted,
to permit defenders to collaborate and achieve broad effect against malicious actors.

He sketched a scenario involving information sharing (IACD),
software bills of materials (SBOM), playbooks (CACAO),
and tailored command-and-control (OpenC2).
He asserted that he expected
within a few years,
the DFARs (which govern DoD acquisition)
would begin to require meeting these standards.
