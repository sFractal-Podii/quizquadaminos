## This section being redone
Don't forget to update answer key

This is the section with questions about the
Cybersecurity Automation Village.
These questions are worth more points
than in other sections.
And they give superpower powerups as well.

### More Points!
But remember that there is a points multiplier
for answers.
The points multiplier depends on how many bricks
have dropped in quadblocks.
So these questions are worth even more
if you have more bricks.

For example, this question is worth
250 points if you have not played any bricks yet.

But is worth 250 X 2 = 500 points if just one brick has
reached bottom.

It is worth 250 X 3 = 750 points if you have played 10 bricks.
So if you already have 8 bricks,
maybe play a few more to get that extra 250 points
for this question
(or next question since you are already here).

Or play 20 bricks and get a X5 multiplier.

And some of the later questions
in the section are worth 1,000 points
so the multiplier really benefits.
