## Cybersecurity Automation Village
The Cybersecurity Automation Village is for sharing information, prototyping, testing, and specifying interoperability among cybersecurity automation technologies.
This is the sixish time the Village is being run (its name morphed thru the years).

The Village is organized by the Cybersecurity Automation SubProject (CASP) of 
the Open Cybersecurity Alliance (OCA).

The OCA is comprised of global like-minded cybersecurity vendors, end users, 
thought leaders and individuals who are interested in cybersecurity automation.

CASP is a forum where products from all vendors, researchers, and software publishers can freely exchange information,
insights, and reference implementations via commonly developed code and tooling, 
using mutually agreed upon technologies, specifications, and procedures.
