## IOB
The current cyber threat landscape is marked by frequent, impactful, and sophisticated attacks. Traditional methods of sharing Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are not as effective to address the speed and scale of these attacks. In response, the OCA Indicator of Behavior (IOB) Sub-Project unites key CTI stakeholders to focus on understanding patterns of behavior associated with malicious cyber activity. The initiative aims to share sets of observed adversary behaviors, analytics for detection, and playbooks/workflows for correlation and response. The goal is to create a standard representation of cyber adversary behaviors that make it easier to share repeatable sets of adversary behaviors across multiple campaigns as well as workflows and playbooks to correlate those detections and respond to the threat. 

# Question:
Which of the following is a focus of the OCA IOB Sub-Project? 

## Answers
- Develop detections for advanced Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).
- Focus on government-exclusive efforts for cybersecurity.
- Create a standard that represents cyber adversary behaviors for collective defense. **[Answer]**
- Replace IOCs with IOBs, and eventually introduce IOAs (Indicators of Anomalies)
