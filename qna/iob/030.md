## IoB
The motivation to represent adversary behavior stems from the limitations
of reactive defense measures focused on Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) data.
Adversaries adapt quickly, discarding known IOCs, necessitating 
a more proactive approach. 
Traditional detection analytics and hunt guidance, while valuable, 
often lack scalability and specificity, leading to challenges 
in keeping pace with rapidly evolving cyberattacks. 
To address this, there is a need for a different set of analytics 
focused on correlating alerts based on adversary behavior 
rather than individual steps. 
Standardized sharing of such information, 
including analytics and correlation workflows, 
is crucial to empower collective defense efforts, 
especially for organizations with varying levels of cybersecurity capabilities.

# Question:
What is the primary motivation for shifting focus 
from traditional Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) 
to Indicators of Behavior (IOBs) in the context of cybersecurity?

## Answers
- Enhancing manual evaluation of thousands of IOCs daily.
- The lack of a strong format for sharing IOCs, making it easier to correlate them.
- Writing highly specific detections for individual adversary actions.
- Proactively correlating alerts based on adversary behavior rather than individual steps.
