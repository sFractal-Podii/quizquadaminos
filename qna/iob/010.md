## IOB
The Indicators of Behavior (IOB) sub project aims to proactively understand and represent patterns associated with malicious cyber activity. The goal is to establish a standardized representation of cyber adversary actions. This involves sharing sets of observed adversary actions across various campaigns, sharing the analytics for detecting those actions, and creating and sharing playbooks/workflows to correlate those detections. The emphasis is on indicators related to actions and patterns, providing a nuanced perspective beyond traditional Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).
