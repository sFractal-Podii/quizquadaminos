## CACAO
The OCA CACAO Roaster subproject is an open-source, 
community-driven web application that can be used to 
design, generate, modify, store, digitally sign and verify CACAO playbooks.

CACAO is a standardized machine-processable framework for orchestrating and automating 
course-of-action playbooks in cybersecurity. 
It streamlines the creation, execution, and exchange of playbooks, 
making it easier for security teams to respond to incidents, 
mitigate threats, and protect their networks.

Roaster was chosed as the name since just like a roaster turns cacao into edible cocoa, 
Roaster helps easily create CACAO playbooks.
