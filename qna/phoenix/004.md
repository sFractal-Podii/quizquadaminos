## Phoenix
This game/website was designed using the Phoenix Framework.
Phoenix is a web development framework written in Elixir
which implements the server-side Model View Controller (MVC) pattern.
Phoenix provides the best of both worlds - high developer productivity
and high application performance.
It also has some interesting new twists like channels for implementing
realtime features and pre-compiled templates for blazing speed.
The 'let it fail' philosophy of the underlying OTP ecosystem
makes it easier to design in both reliability and security.
