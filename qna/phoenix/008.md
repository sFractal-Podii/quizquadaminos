## Elixir Q2
- Phoenix is a web development framework written in Elixir which implements the server-side Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. Phoenix provides the best of both worlds - high developer productivity and high application performance. It also has some interesting new twists like channels for implementing realtime features and pre-compiled templates for blazing speed. The 'let it fail' philosophy of the underlying OTP ecosystem makes it easier to design in both reliability and security.
