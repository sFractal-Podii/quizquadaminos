## EEF
The Erlang Ecosytem Foundation (EEF)
Security Working group
(https://erlef.org/wg/security)
has the mission
to provide security solutions
for the erlang & elixir ecosystems.

The Erlang and Elixir ecosystems are known
for their high-availability because of the BEAM
virtual machine with it's
OTP ("One Tough Platform") libraries.
Because of the value to security of
having Software Bill of Materials
(SBOM),
the Security Working group
advocated for SBOM
creation as part of the ecosystem
build chains.
The tools can be found at:
- Elixir https://hex.pm/packages/sbom
- Erlang https://hex.pm/packages/rebar3_sbom
