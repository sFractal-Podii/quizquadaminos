## EEF
The Erlang/Elixir ecosystem is known
for it's high-availability because of the BEAM
virtual machine with
OTP ("One Tough Platform") libraries.
http://erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf
is a seminal paper on "Making reliable
distributed systems
in the presence of
software errors".

The opening paragraph of this thesis is:
"The work described in this thesis is the result of a research program
started in 1981 to find better ways of programming Telecom applications.
These applications are large programs which despite careful
testing will probably contain many errors when the program is put into
service. We assume that such programs do contain errors, and investigate
methods for building reliable systems despite such errors.
The research has resulted in the development of a new programming
language (called Erlang), together with a design methodology, and set of
libraries for building robust systems (called OTP)."

# Question:
Erlang was invented to solve what problem:

## Answers
- Joe Armstrong needed a thesis topic
- Ericsson wanted to honor the Danish mathematician Agner Erlang
* Robust high-availability systems that can continue to operate in the presence of software errors
- syntactic sugar for sentence-like use of periods in a programming language
