## Hex SBOM
This game was written in Elixir using the Phoenix framework.
The Elixir build tool is "mix"
and the Elixir package manager/repository is "hex".
The hex package "sbom" (see https://hexdocs.pm/sbom/readme.html)
is used by mix to create SBOMs as part of the build process.
This allows automated SBOM creation as part of the normal build process.
The SBOM for this game/website was automagically created as part of the build,
and in included as part of the website, accessible from the home page.
