## Darkweb

In Lauren's talk on the dark web,
she explains the difference between
the surface web, the deep web,
and the dark web.

### Surface, Deep, Dark Webs

The surface web is the websites
that are indexed by search engines
and visible to the average user.
I.e. the 'public' internet.
The surface web is only approximately
5% of the internet.

The deep web is the legitimate part of the internet
that is only accessible thru authentication.
For example the banking pages beyond your banks home page.
Another example is AT&T's internal networks.
The deep web makes up 90% of the internet.

The dark web is the hidden part of the internet
that can only be reached anonymously via techniques
like the onion router (TOR).
It is the 5% of the internet most used for nefarious
activities.
