## Frequently seen vulnerabilities

Matt, in his talk, tells us about incidents
that hurt AT&T because attackers took advantage
of avoidable vulnerabilities in AT&T written software.

One example is leakage of sensitive data
because HTTP GET was used
when POST should have been used.
The problem is GET is logged in the webserverâ€™s logs
AND in the browser history.
Anyone with access to either of those
can recover that data
(passwords, SSNs, session cookies, etc)

# Question:
Why is POST better than GET for web transactions involving sensitive data?

## Answers
- GET data is logged in webserver logs and browser history
- POST uses US Postal Service guaranteed delivery
- POST sends data on the unencrypted URL
- GET data is never included in bookmarks
