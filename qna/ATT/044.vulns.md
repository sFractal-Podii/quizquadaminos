## AT&T Category of Quiz Questions

Matt, in his talk, tells us about incidents
that hurt AT&T because attackers took advantage
of avoidable vulnerabilities in AT&T written software.

One topic he discusses is that
attackers take advantage of guessing information
from information they see,
for example consecutively numbering id's
starting at 1.

# Question:
If an attacker sees a URL ending with ?id=1, what is their next likely move?

## Answers
- Giving up knowing how good AT&T software is
- Sending the URL setting id=2, id=3, id=4, and so on to enumerate all the possible values.
- Searching the darkweb for all id's = 1
- Searching the cso.att.com page for this talk
