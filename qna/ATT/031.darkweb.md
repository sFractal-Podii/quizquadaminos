## Dark Web

In Lauren's talk on the dark web,
she points out AT&T does not have a presence
on the dark web.
We rely on a third party vendor,
who has a presence on over
140 different forums and marketplaces.
They collect information and make it available,
and searchable in a tool.
We gather our intelligence from there.
