## Open C2
OpenC2 allows for vendor-agnostic cybertime response to attacks. One way to
understand cyber defense activities is as an *OODA Loop* (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act). A cyber
defense version of an OODA loop includes the following activities:

- Sensing: gathering of data regarding system activities
- Sense Making: evaluating data using analytics to understand what's happening
- Decision Making: determining a course-of-action to respond to system events
- Acting: executing the course-of-action

OpenC2 focuses on the final stage of the loop, Acting, in order to implement the
decision developed through the preceding stepts.
