## OpenC2
OpenC2 *Actuator Profiles* specify the subset of the OpenC2 language relevant in
the context of specific cyber defense functions, such as firewalls or anti-virus
systems. Cyber defense components and devices will typically implement multiple
profiles. An Actuator Profile refines the meaning of the OpenC2 language
elements (actions, targets, command arguments, results) used to perform the
actuator function, and often extends the OpenC2 Language with new targets
specific to a particular cyber defense function.
