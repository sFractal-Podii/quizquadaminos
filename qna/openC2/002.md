## OpenC2
An OpenC2 Command describes an *Action* to be performed on a *Target* and may
include information identifying the Actuator or Actuators that are to execute
the Command. For example, a Command could `deny` (action) a specific
`ipv4_address` (target). The following list describes the main four components
of a Command:

 * Action (required): The task or activity to be performed.
 * Target (required): The object of the action. The Action is performed on the Target.
 * Arguments (optional): Provide additional information on how the command is to be performed, such as date/time, periodicity, duration, etc.
 * Profile (optional): Specifies the Actuator Profile that defines the function to be performed by the command.
