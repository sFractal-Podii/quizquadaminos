## Open Chain
OpenChain and the Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) Best Practices are both Linux Foundation initiatives
that identify Open Source process quality criteria. OpenChain focuses on
- i) improving compliance programs within organizations that use Open Source from different projects in their solutions and
- ii) the process for contributing back.

In contrast, the CII best practices badge focuses on
criteria for well-run Open Source projects themselves.
