## Open Chain
OpenChain is a Linux Foundation Project to help identify and share
the core components of a high quality open source compliance program.
OpenChain builds trust in Open Source by making things simpler,
more efficient and more consistent.
It is the industry-standard for managing
Open Source compliance across the supply chain.

The OpenChain Project vision is a supply chain
where open source is delivered with trusted
and consistent compliance information.
