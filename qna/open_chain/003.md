## Open Chain
Open Chain has self-certification, an independent compliance assessment,
or third-party certification.
Self-certification is thru a questionaire 'conformance in questions'
with questions like:
- "Do you have a documented policy governing the open source license compliance of the Supplied Software?"
- "Do you have open source component records for the Supplied Software which demonstrate the documented procedure was properly followed?"
- "Do you have a documented procedure governing open source contribution?"
