## OASIS Open
OASIS Open is where individuals, organizations, and governments
come together to solve some of the worldâ€™s biggest technical challenges
through the development of open code and open standards.

Example OASIS cybersecurity standards include:
- XACML 3.0 - "eXtensible Access Control Markup Language" defines a declarative fine-grained, attribute-based access control policy language, an architecture, and a processing model describing how to evaluate access requests according to the rules defined in policies
- STIX 2.1 - Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) is a language for expressing cyber threat and observable information.
- CACAO - defines the schema and taxonomy for collaborative automated course of action operations (CACAO) security playbooks and how these playbooks can be created, documented, and shared in a structured and standardized way across organizational boundaries and technological solutions.
- SAML - Security Assertion Markup Language defines a standard framework for creating and exchanging security information between online partners
- OpenC2 - Open Command & Control is a standardized language for the command and control of technologies that provide or support cyber defenses. By providing a common language for machine-to-machine communication, OpenC2 is vendor and application agnostic, enabling interoperability across a range of cyber security tools and applications
- and many more
