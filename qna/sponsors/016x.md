## Grox.io
The tetrominoes game that is the basis of this game
is developed as part of a Grox.io course
in teaching software development.

Grox.io teaches using  
the Dreyfus learning model,
a scientific teaching method
that includes learning by doing.
Books provide the metaphors experts need to build context,
step-by-step instructions for beginners,
and the exercises that intermediates need to learn.
Practicing (individual and group) imprints the skills.
