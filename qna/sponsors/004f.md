# Question:
Which of the following methods would a solid writing
consultant use to bolster your cybersecurity product?


## Answers
-	Communications rife with ambiguity. “It’ll be here soon and it’ll be great for some people, but not for others.”
-	Willful overselling. “The product in question will usher in a new era of prosperity that promises to undo millennia worth of injustices while paving the road for a veritable Elysium.”
-	Using inaccessible language and coded lingo by means of establishing intellectual superiority. “In the plenum of the increasingly deterritorialized metaverse where software abstractions join the internet of things in a multi-faceted cybernetic monolith known by some as ‘the stack,’ the horizon of enterprise solutions can be found at the intersection of your strategic aims and a proper implementation of our software.”
*	Utilization of clear and concise language. “You wouldn’t buy a car that works great on flat streets, but stalls going uphill. Why would you entrust your company’s cybersecurity to a product that doesn’t deliver when it counts?”
