## Kestrel
Kestrel is a threat hunting language which
provides an abstraction for threat hunters to focus on what to hunt instead of how to hunt.

Kestrel is a threat hunting language aiming to make cyber threat hunting fast by providing 
a layer of abstraction to build reusable, composable, and shareable hunt-flow.

What does it mean by hunt fast?

- Do NOT write the same IoB pattern in different data source queries.
- Do NOT write one-time-use adapaters to connect hunt steps.
- Do NOT waste your existing analytic scripts/programs in future hunts.
- Do construct your hunt-flow from smaller reuseable hunt-flow.
- Do share your huntbook with your future self and your colleagues.
- Do get interactive feedback and revise hunt-flow on the fly.

Besides being a threat hunting language, the namesake of the project is also a type of falcon.
The American Kestrel, is the smallest and most common falcon in North America. 
Formerly called "sparrowhawk", 
a misnomer as it is a true falcon and is unrelated genetically to the Eurasian sparrowhawk.
